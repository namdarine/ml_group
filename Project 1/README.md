## 1. What does the model you have implemented do and when should it be used?  
  

## 2. How did you test your model to determine if it is working reasonably correctly?  
  

## 3. What parameters have you exposed to users of your implementation in order to tune performance?  
  

## 4. Are there specific inputs that your implementation has trouble with? Given more time, could you work around these or is it fundamental to the model?
